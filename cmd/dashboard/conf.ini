# Application settings
[SETTINGS]
# SERVERHOST : host address to run HTTP server on,
# Use 0.0.0.0 to run on all hosts, 127.0.0.1 to run only locally
# default 0.0.0.0
SERVERHOST=0.0.0.0

# SERVERPORT : local port to bind HTTP server to,
# Use any suitable one
# default 8951
SERVERPORT=8951

# RETRIES : maximum number of tries to resend every failed message,
# Use as per requirement
# default 3
RETRIES=3

# BUFFERSIZE : number of messages that should be fetched from database for processing,
# This value must be greater than 0
# This value must be greater than BUFFERLOW
# Normally, you'd want to set this relative to number of devices you have,
# 10*NumberOfDevices should be good enough
# default 10
BUFFERSIZE=10

# BUFFERLOW : least number of messages that should be in the system ready for processing,
# The system will make sure to check database again if the number of messages in buffer
# are lower than this value
# This value must be less than BUFFER
# Suggested value is 30/40% of BUFFERSIZE
# default 4
BUFFERLOW=4

#
# Timeouts

# MSGTIMEOUTLONG : Duration after which system will check for new messages automatically
# This will happen even if the system is idle for really long time
# The value is given in minutes
# default 20
MSGTIMEOUTLONG=20


#
# Devices
# -------
# You may use more than one devices to share the load.
# Load sharing works mostly in round-robin form, but their is no specific order.
# it may change in runtime if any of the devices take longer than others to
# process a message
#

# DEVICES : number of devices that are configured
# There must be a [DEVICE*] section described for as many devices set as value of
# this setting
# If the DEVICES value is greater than total number of [DEVICE*] sections, program will abort,
# If the DEVICES value is lesser than total number of [DEVICE*] sections, first N devices will
# be used where N = value of DEVICES
# default 1
DEVICES=1

# [DEVICE*]
# Devices index starts with 0
[DEVICE0]

# COMPORT : port that device is connected to
# Example,
# Windows: COMPORT=COM1
# Linux: COMPORT=/dev/ttyUSB0
COMPORT=

# BAUDRATE : baud rate, if you are unsure about this, leave default
# default 115200
BAUDRATE=115200

# DEVID : a friendly device identifier that will be used to refer to this device
# Use any suitable one, either a name or number
# Example,
# DEVID=MyModem
# DEVID=9890098900
DEVID=

#
#[DEVICE1]
#COMPORT=COM2
#BAUDRATE=115200
#DEVID=
